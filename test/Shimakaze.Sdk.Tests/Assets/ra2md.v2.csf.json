    "COOP:Camp11v": "Commander's Log -Texas, USA: The first Soviet unit to enter the United States was the Russian 2nd Motorized Rifle Division. They quickly set up bases in Southern Texas from which they could strike at US strategic assets all across the Southwest. American forces were quickly overwhelmed and it soon looked as though Russian and Cuban divisions would occupy all major cities in the southern US. Only a few diehard American commanders stood in the way.",
    "COOP:Camp12": "Soviet and Cuban forces are striking into Alabama. Destroy them.",
    "COOP:Camp12v": "Commander's Log - Alabama, USA: In the 2nd week of the war, despite massive loses, Soviet and Cuban forces attempted to link their battle lines in Alabama. Though their resources were nearly depleted, American commanders managed to put up a stiff resistance.",
    "COOP:Camp13": "Cuban forces have invaded Florida. Push them back into the sea.",
    "COOP:Camp13v": "Commander's Log - Florida, USA: While Russian forces raged across the Old South, Cuban forces quickly invaded Florida. Their first attacks were successful, however the Cubans met with grass-roots resistance when American commanders managed to procure a few MCVs from European blockade-runners.",
    "COOP:Camp14": "Soviet forces threaten Atlanta. Find and destroy their supply base.",
    "COOP:Camp14v": "Commander's Log - Georgia, USA: In the 4th week of the war, Russian and Cuban forces gathered in the Georgian countryside. Their mission was simple, gather resources, replenish two badly damaged Soviet divisions and then rage into the undefended city of Atlanta. The Soviet policy was clear, resistance must be punished and the American rebels must be taught a lesson. Before the Soviets were ready, a British spy sent word of the attack to American Commanders and battle was joined.",
    "COOP:Camp15": "The Soviets have a network of bases along the Mexican border. Destroy them to end the war.",
    "COOP:Camp15v": "Commander's Log - Texas, USA: As the Soviets were pushed back out of the United States, the last survivors of the battle for Texas laid siege to a mighty Russian battle fortress on the Mexican border. From this base the Soviets could make air and nuclear strikes deep into the United States. The Soviet base had to be destroyed, no matter what the price.",
    "COOP:Camp21": "Strike a blow for freedom, your forces are in Romania, destroy all Soviet forces.",
    "COOP:Camp21v": "Commander's Log - Eastern Europe: While the Soviets were striking against America, the Europeans remained silent. When the Soviets nuked Chicago, the Europeans prayed the war would not come to their shores, but when the Soviets attacked Paris, even the most cautious commander knew that the time had come for war. It was a combined French and German force that struck the first blow into Eastern Europe, led by the most aggressive European commanders on the continent.",
    "COOP:Camp22": "The Soviets have counterattacked into Germany. You must hold the line.",
    "COOP:Camp22v": "Commander's Log - Eastern Europe: Despite their initial success, the Allies soon found themselves surrounded on all sides by entrenched Soviet forces. Soviet units quickly cut off any chance of retreat in Romania and the Allied expeditionary force was forced to fight their way back to friendly battle lines.",
    "COOP:Camp23": "You have been ordered to seize control of the Black Sea and her harbors.",
    "COOP:Camp23v": "Commander's Log - Romania: As weeks stretched into months, the Allies tired as Europe was once again a grim battleground for the most powerful nations on earth. Eager to take the battle to the enemy, the Allies sent their best commanders into the Mediterranean to seize control of vital island strongholds and prepare large fleets for an attack into the Black Sea.",
    "COOP:Camp24": "In a surprise attack, your forces have been sent into Poland. Crush the unprepared Soviets.",
    "COOP:Camp24v": "Commander's Log - Poland: With the Soviets distracted by a major amphibious landing on their own shores, Allied forces seized the opportunity to make a major armored attack into Poland. In the 4th month the Allies lead their forces across the Rhine at the dead of night in the middle of winter, taking the Soviet bases completely by surprise.",
    "COOP:Camp25": "The drive into Russia has begun. Your forces are in the Ukraine and face a desperate Red Army.",
    "COOP:Camp25v": "Commander's Log - Ukraine, Soviet Union: With most of Europe still weak from battle, two European commanders took it upon themselves to put an end to the war in Europe by striking against the main Soviet Headquarters inside the Russian border. Without authorization or approval from their governments, these commanders gathered what forces remained and struck what they hoped would be a final blow.",
    "COOP:Camp31": "Destroy all Soviet forces along the Sea of Japan.",
    "COOP:Camp31v": "Commander's Log - Japan: The Korean government remained neutral during the first few months of the war until a Korean reporter learned that the Soviets had used Psychic Technology to mind control key members of the Korean leadership. When the story broke Korea went to war, and her commanders were to fight in almost every country in the Far East. The first attack took the Soviets almost completely by surprise as the Koreans fought along the coast of Japan for naval supremacy of the Pacific.",
    "COOP:Camp32": "Defend Vietnam from Soviet aggression.",
    "COOP:Camp32v": "Commander's Log - Vietnam: As the Soviets continued to spread across South East Asia, consuming the small countries that stood in their way, the Korean Army dispatched two divisions to Vietnam to defend it against a major Soviet strike force. The Korean commanders were outnumbered almost two to one and knew that only superior leadership would save them from certain defeat.",
    "COOP:Camp33": "Your home nation, Korea is threatened, defend your lands at any cost.",
    "COOP:Camp33v": "Commander's Log - Republic of Korea: Three weeks after declaring war on the Soviet Union, Korean commanders faced an invasion of their own country by a secret Soviet division hidden from their intelligence network by powerful psychic technology. Using what forces remained in country the Koreans marched to their own border and prepared to make the Soviets pay for every inch of ground.",
    "COOP:Camp34": "Invade the frozen wastes of eastern Russia and destroy the Soviet bases.",
    "COOP:Camp34v": "Commander's Log - Harbin, Soviet Union: With most of the Soviet forces in the Far East neutralized or destroyed the Korean High Command ordered their generals to take the fight to the enemy and Korean forces invaded the frozen wastes of Eastern Russia.",
    "COOP:Camp35": "Complete your invasion of Siberia and destroy the Soviet supply bases that fuel war effort.",
    "COOP:Camp35v": "Commander's Log - Siberia, Soviet Union: Despite massive losses to battle and the bitter cold, the Korean invasion force was not deterred and moved quickly against the oil fields of eastern Siberia. With the invasion in America going poorly for the Soviets and the European Allies attacking into Russia herself, the Koreans had a unique opportunity to deliver a crippling blow to the Soviet war machine. Korea had a chance to make a huge difference in the overall war.",
    "COOP:Camp41": "Your legions have invaded Italy. Destroy all who oppose you.",
    "COOP:Camp41v": "Commander's Log - Italy: While the Russians managed to persuade a few pariah warlord states to join their cause, most were only in the war for their own gain. It was a chance for many warlord nations to prey upon their neighbors, to expand their borders and to seize the resources they needed to maintain their failing economies. While Soviet forces fought around the globe, Iraq and Libya seized the opportunity for a joint invasion of southern Italy. Only a pitiful few French and English forces opposed them.",
    "COOP:Camp42": "Greece is our next target. Destroy any Allies who dare to oppose our conquest.",
    "COOP:Camp42v": "Commander's Log - Greece: As the English and French rallied their forces at the Alps the combined forces of the Iraqi and Libyan armies smashed into Greece. The Grecian army was overrun in a matter of days but a combined French and British force brought by boat from India and French Malaysia managed to put up a token resistance.",
    "COOP:Camp43": "The French and English have counterattacked in Italy. Destroy their advanced bases.",
    "COOP:Camp43v": "Commander's Log - Italy: Their supply lines overextended and their armies scattered across southern Europe, the Libyans and Iraqis were vulnerable to an Allied counterattack. In the 3rd week of the war the French and English attacked, striking at the ports of southern Italy in an attempt to cut-off Iraqi forces from their naval supply lines.",
    "COOP:Camp44": "The Allies have paradropped into the fertile plane just outside Baghdad. Destroy them.",
    "COOP:Camp44v": "Commander's Log - Iraq: After their failed attack, the Allies tried one last desperate gamble in the 4th week of the war. While Libyan death squads hunted down Allied troops in the Italy war-zone, the English and French took what forces they had remaining and made a massive airdrop in the fertile river basin outside of Baghdad, hoping to set up bases to siege the city.",
    "COOP:Camp45": "The French have built a massive fortress in northern Greece. This is the last point of resistance.",
    "COOP:Camp45v": "Commander's Log - Greece: Assisted by French base defenses, the Allies built a massive fortress in their last remaining stronghold of northern Greece. The French and English held out for nearly three weeks before the Iraqi and Libyan armies sent in their most battle-hardened commanders to find a way to break through the Allied defenses.",
    "COOP:Camp51": "Destroy the Russian fleets and naval bases in the North Sea.",
    "COOP:Camp51v": "Commander's Log - North Sea: While the Soviet army was busy crushing American resistance on the Eastern Seaboard, the Soviet Navy fought a bloody battle to cross the North Atlantic and deliver supplies and reinforcements to their troops. The first battles were fought on tiny islands in the North Sea where combined Allied forces attempted to hold back the Soviet battle groups and destroy any bases the Soviets managed to build.",
    "COOP:Camp52": "The Soviets have invaded Norway. We must save this ally from Soviet dominion.",
    "COOP:Camp52v": "Commander's Log - Norway: The initial Allied success prompted an immediate and brutal response from the Soviets. Threatened by superior Allied naval forces, the Soviets invaded the neutral countries of Sweden and Norway to lay claim to the warm water ports that would allow them to build large fleets and strike anywhere along the northern coast of Europe. The Allies gathered their best commanders and with only a handful of forces, sent them into Norway to hold back the Soviet horde.",
    "COOP:Camp53": "A secret Soviet base has been discovered in the British Isles. Destroy it before it is too late.",
    "COOP:Camp53v": "Commander's Log - British Isles: As the Soviets became more desperate to deliver war materials to their failing armies in America, they began to try more devious means of breaking the Allied blockade in the North Atlantic. In the 3rd month of the war, a small Soviet force made a secret landing in northern Britain and set up a base. By the time the Allies discovered the Soviet presence, it was nearly too late.",
    "COOP:Camp54": "The Soviets have swept into Germany. Stop their advance and destroy their forces.",
    "COOP:Camp54v": "Commander's Log - Germany: As the war entered its 4th month the Allies grew bold and began major attacks into Poland from Austria, striking against Soviet bases and liberating thousands of Polish civilians. The Soviets responded quickly with three armored divisions that swept into eastern Germany, cutting off the Allied attackers. The battle quickly degenerated into a chaotic base versus base duel, with the outcome sure to change the course of the war in Europe.",
    "COOP:Camp55": "Victory is close at hand, destroy the Soviet naval bases in the Baltic to end the war for the North Atlantic.",
    "COOP:Camp55v": "Commander's Log - Northern Baltic Sea: Victory after victory had brought the Allies into the Northern Baltic where they hoped to destroy the Soviet naval bases that continually reinforced the Soviet North Atlantic fleet. The Allies were only able to spare a few forces from their blockade groups for the assault, leaving them outnumbered three to one in what they hoped would be the final battle of the North Atlantic campaign.",
